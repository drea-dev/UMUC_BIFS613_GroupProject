# UMUC_BIFS613_GroupProject


RMD code created in RStudio to review TCGA Mesothelioma data. 

This code will run PCA analysis and generate graphs to compare gender and gene expression in patients diagnosed with mesothelioma.

Original goal of the project was to try and associate expression (or lack thereof) BAP-1 with gender and mesothelioma diagnoses.

Overall results were inconclusive.
